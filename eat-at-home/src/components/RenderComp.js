      Description:
        "Freshly meals come individually packaged and portioned, so these work well for single folks or couples without kids. They are assembled much like TV dinners but are far more attractive and -- spoiler alert -- they taste better too. Freshly meals arrive very cold but not quite frozen, so it's up to you to heat and eat them right away or freeze a few meals for a rainy day. (Note: Some foods freeze much better than others, I found). Through the website, you can choose a subscription plan that includes as few as four or as many as 12 meals per week. Freshly has plenty of healthy meal choices and options for folks with dietary restrictions, including gluten-free, low-carb and low-calorie. There are, however, almost no plant-based options so this is not a good meal delivery service for vegetarians or vegans. Freshly ships to every state in the lower 48 (sorry, Hawaii and Alaska!) and you can also change, pause or cancel your plan anytime, so it's very low risk if you just want to check it out for a week or two.",

      Description:
        "The service's plans range from four meals a week to 18 meals a week, so you can pick one that best fits your schedule and preferences. If you just need a quick and nutritious supplement to your regular meal routine, the four, six, or eight meal-plan will be best. The 12 or 18-meal plans are good if you don't plan on cooking most of the week. The cost per meal goes down as the number of meals goes up — it's $15 per meal for the four-meal plan versus $11 per meal for the 18-meal plan. Factor 75 updates its menu every week. There are breakfast, lunch, and dinner options and you can filter by different nutritional needs such as paleo, keto, and plant-based. There are also add-ons under the factor category, including healthy desserts, soups, and cold-pressed juices for an additional cost. Meals are always delivered on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday depending on your zip code. They're shipped in insulated boxes with cold gel packs, and you can store them in the fridge for up to seven days. Whenever you're ready to eat, just heat the tray up in the microwave or oven.",

With a box of 10, 20 or 30 frozen vegan meals delivered right to your door, it makes going vegan nearly effortless. But at a minimum of $9.90 each, they’re far more expensive than a frozen meal from the supermarket. Veestro offers subscriptions of 10, 20 or 30 fully prepared frozen meals. The meals serve one person each and just need to be reheated before serving. Subscriptions can be changed or canceled at any time. Customers can choose to select their meals themselves with the A La Carte Plan, or let the company choose for them with the Chef’s Choice Plan. With Chef’s Choice, you can still slightly customize your options by choosing the Customer Favorites, High-Protein or Gluten-Free menus.",

Subscribers create an account, select one of the four plans, and choose their meals for the week. If you don’t want to select meals, or if you forget, you’ll be sent the default meals based on your meat preferences. ",

But those groceries — bags of stir-fry vegetables, tubs of peanut sauce, pouches of rice — form the basis of easy two- or three- (and sometimes four) component meals. Think cauliflower rice with chicken and wild mushroom meatballs topped with green chili sauce. Just heat, combine and eat. The groceries are all selected with health in mind, so even though Hungryroot isn’t a vegan, dairy-free or wheat-free service, many of its items are. For example, a creamy white sauce for pasta is actually made with cashews instead of heavy cream, and it might be paired with sausages made with chicken instead of pork, and chickpea pasta or zucchini noodles instead of pasta made with wheat flour.",
